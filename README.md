# Event Planner Project

A web application for planning and managing your events, built with Java and Spring Boot.

## About This Project

This project is a web application that helps you plan and organize events from start to finish. You can create an account, plan new events, manage your guest list, and share photos and videos after the event is over.

This application is built as a single project, with **Spring Boot** handling both the backend logic and the frontend user interface (using a templating engine like **Thymeleaf**).

## Core Features

* **Secure User Accounts:** Users must create an account and log in to manage their private events.
* **Event Planning:** Create, edit, and view all your upcoming events in one place.
* **Guest List Management:** Easily send digital invitations to your guests.
* **RSVP Tracking:** See a live list of who has confirmed they are attending, so you always know your headcount.
* **Photo & Video Galleries:** After the event, you can upload photos and videos to a shared gallery for your guests to see.
